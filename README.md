# Sounds of Nature (in progress)
Welcome to the Sounds of Nature Github repository! This project aims to use supervised and unsupervised learning methods to develop a processing chain in Python for the analysis of acoustic landscapes and animal sound emissions. The project has two main components: characterization of acoustic landscapes and species recognition. We hope this repository will be a useful resource for researchers and practitioners interested in integrative monitoring of the environment and biodiversity using soundscapes.
