# Sounds of Nature (in progress)
Welcome to the Sounds of Nature Github repository! This project aims to use supervised and unsupervised learning methods to develop a processing chain in Python for the analysis of acoustic landscapes and animal sound emissions. The project has two main components: characterization of acoustic landscapes and species recognition. We hope this repository will be a useful resource for researchers and practitioners interested in integrative monitoring of the environment and biodiversity using soundscapes.

## Overview

 - ./code/
	 - [create_indices_dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/amarmeddahi/sounds-of-nature/blob/main/code/create_indices_dataset.ipynb "create_indices_dataset.ipynb") -> creates a representation of over 60 acoustic indices from raw audio data
 - ./data/
